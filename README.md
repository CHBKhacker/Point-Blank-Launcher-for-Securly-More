**Point Blank Launcher for Securly/More**

This was made with the help of SprinksMC(Bypassi), as this project is in beta, expect bugs, and this was not made for every extension. If you have Securly => https://tinyurl.com/bettergoofcurly (You may have to reload) iBoss => https://tinyurl.com/goofboss Cisco Umbrella => https://tinyurl.com/goofumbrella Securly Classroom => https://tinyurl.com/goofclassroom Blocksi => https://tinyurl.com/goofsi Impero => https://tinyurl.com/goofimpero

On each of these pages should have a link, go to the link corresponding with your extension/blocker. Once you've found the link, and it opens a blank page, use the code from https://point-blank-launcher.glitch.me/launcher.js And you should see the UI, you'll have many options, which are being worked on, including a dns emulator, which doesn't work if your extension/blocker block page starts with chrome-extension://, soft disable, which works for all extensions, if you have iBoss, I recommend you use Ingot for iBoss. And running scripts, which at the moment is being improved. As the running scripts is in progress, we recommend you don't use it.
